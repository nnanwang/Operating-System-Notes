# Memory Manager

- **Memory Allocation** <br>
 responsible for allocating memory to processes
- **Address Mapping** <br>
  1. Necessary: 1) to run same code in different physical memory in different processes 2) to support process address space abstraction<br>
  2. Memory Management Unit (MMU): responsible for mapping **logical addresses** generated by CPU instructions to **physical addresses** seen by memory controller

### MMU (Memory Management Unit)
- **MMU** usually on the same chip as the CPU
- **Translation** is tranparent to user/program
