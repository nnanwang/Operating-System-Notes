# Memory Management
Memory Sharing: "Space-sliced"<br>
Goals: Utilization, latency

#### Responsibilties
- **Memory Allocation** <br>
 responsible for allocating memory to processes
- **Address Mapping, necessary** <br>
  1) to run same code in different physical memory in different processes 
  2) to support process address space abstraction
  3) Memmory Management Unit (MMU): responsible for mapping logical addresses generated by CPU instructions to physical addresses seen by memory controller
  
#### MMU (Memory Management Unit)
- **MMU** usually on the same chip as the CPU
- **Translation** is tranparent to user/program

## Address Mapping
### Logical(vitual) Addresses: An Abstraction of Memory
- memory refrences in assembly language instructions <br>*(e.g.,* BR X, LOAD R2, Y *)*
- starts at 0, contiguous
- reality: must be mapped to physical address (address mapping)

### Advantages
#### 1. Efficient Allocation of Memory
- Processes allocate and free memory as they run
- Need to find a way to make "room" for P1 to grow if P2 is right next to it

#### 2. Virtualization
- Allow a process to act as if has all the physical memory to itself 
- Allow all processes together to act if memory is much larger than reality

#### 3. Efficient use of Resources
- Don't waste memory
- Keep it all working

## Generating Logical Address
Generate at:
1. **Compile-time** - relative addressing resoled here (*e.g.,* X, Y)
2. **Link, load-time** - addresses dependent on external modules resolved here
3. **Execution-time** - addresses generated by dynamic loading/linking resolved here
